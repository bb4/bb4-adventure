  * @param title title of the story
  * @param name name of the story used as an identifier for by convention
  *             resolution of locations and things like that. e.g. "ludlow".

  * @param date date story was created.
  * @param resourcePath where the images and sounds will come from
  * @param rootTag the root tag name. Either script or hierarchy depending on which sort of XML dtd we have.
